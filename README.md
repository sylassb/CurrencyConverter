<b><strong>"Digital Innovation One - Carrefour Bootcamp - Android Currency Converter App Challenge"</b></strong>

<b><i>Challenge</b></i>

The goal of this project is to create a Currency Conversion App, going through the entire development process using Kotlin, one of the most up-and-coming programming languages in recent years. To do this, we're going to consume a public API using Kotlin's core libraries and design patterns. Finally, you are challenged to deliver your own project, incorporating your own evolutions and improvements!


<b><i>Description</b></i>

Following instructions from the challenge proposed by Digital Innovation One, I built an Android app seeking to introduce architectural design pattern MVVM. The main objective of the challenge is to consume an API to access real-time currency conversion rates. For this I used a Free API that makes available the conversion rates published by the European Central Bank https://exchangeratesapi.io/. As a challenge I also used the Dagger-Hilt library for dependency injection.
